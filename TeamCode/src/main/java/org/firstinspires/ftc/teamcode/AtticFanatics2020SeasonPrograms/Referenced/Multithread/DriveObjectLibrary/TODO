- Implement waiting for previous action in Sequence
- Get IMU set up, possibly incorporate IMU turning
- Get touch sensors set up
- At this point, clean up recording and re-running software. Should not be much work, but optimize and use new DriveObjects more liberally
- Add ways for recording software to measure target positions easier

Known potential issues:
- No way to recognize end of servo movement (?)
- Not sure how to implement setting multiple positions (!)
- Need to eventually allow Action and Sequence to take multiple actions at once (!)
- Starting a thread while one is already active will result in weird results for a part (!)

Shortcuts:
- -> means implies
- (?) -> not sure if needed
- (!) -> done, but unsure if works
