- Add 4th PID term that is max velocity (default 3000)
- Fix PositionThread to work with groups using tolerance
- Get IMU set up, possibly incorporate IMU turning
- Get touch sensors set up
- Get odometry set up
- At this point, clean up recording and re-running software. Should not be much work, but optimize and use new DriveObjects more liberally
- Add ways for recording software to measure target positions easier

Known potential issues:
- No way to recognize end of servo movement (?)
- Starting a thread while one is already active will result in weird results for a part (!)

Shortcuts:
- -> means implies
- (?) -> not sure if needed
- (!) -> done, but unsure if works
