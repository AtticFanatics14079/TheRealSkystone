Driving (Controller 1):
Left Stick = Move
Right Stick = Rotate
Two Speeds (switch between them with a button)
    Full Speed
    1/4 Speed (For foundation or other fine adjustments)
Ramp up speed (increase power by a proportional amount to the analog input on the controller; whenever stick is at 0 set power to 0 immediately)
    Ramping up speed will make driving more natural and will help a lot with preventing the skyscraper from tipping
    Maybe we want do ramp down speed for the slower speed too
    Acceleration kills the tower, not speed

Everything Else (Controller 2):
Gripper: A/B for Open/Close (set values)
Rotate Gripper: Triggers for Rotate (Put the servo in CR mode, and run it at speed equal to analog input; one trigger for each direction)
Extend Arm: DPad Left/Right (With set increments of extension amount) (We need to detect each PRESS at a time, not true while it's pressed)
Raise Scissor: DPad Up/Down (With set increments based on level of skyscraper) (Not sure if scissor lift speed is constant throughout range of motion)
Foundation Hooks: X/Y = Open/Close with set values

Maybe later (but not for this first scrimmage):
Button to press that will look for block and pick it up automatically (rotate bot until stone is in middle, extend arm and pick up, with known orientation)
Automate last step of placing the block (Extend arm, lower a bit, open hand)
Automate moving foundation out into one button
